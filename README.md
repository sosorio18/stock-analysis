# Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to refactor the code in VBA to loop through stock data for year 2017 and 2018 and see if it worked more efficiently than the original code we had.
## Results
After performing a stock analysis on all the stocks for both years it shows that in 2017 the stocks had a greater return rate than in 2018. Since we added a code for a timer to calculate the amount of time it took the code to run from beginning to end, we are able to see if the refactored code works more efficiently than the original. For instance the original script took 0.73 seconds to run the code for year 2017 and 2018. However, as you can see in the images below, the execution time of the refactored script differs.
